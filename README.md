# hostname_generator
A deterministic generator of random hostnames.

A trivial rule and a seeded random number generator allow a human-readable hostname to be associated with a given physical machine,
or a given (re)deployment of VMs

Reports probability of hostname collision with a given deployment size.

The birthday problem is unkind to very large deployments, pull requests welcome to expand the lists or expand the name space.
